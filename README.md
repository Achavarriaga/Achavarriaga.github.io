# About Me

## My name is Andrea. I'm 31 years old and originally from Colombia, an amazing country in South America well known for its coffee beans and delicious food.  English is my second language.  I love learning about other people's cultures and their food.  I believe we can connect more with people through their culture and their food, so  I'm always open to trying new places.  Music and coffee are the keys to having a good day or fixing it if you're having a bad one! _Full of positive energies!_  



## Music I enjoy  &  Food you must try
